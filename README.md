## üîç What is Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)?

**Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** refers to a category of security testing tools designed to scan running web applications for vulnerabilities. These tools interact with your application in real-time, simulating an attacker‚Äôs behavior to identify issues such as:

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* SQL Injection
* Command Injection
* Path Traversal
* Insecure Server Configurations

DAST tools operate without access to the underlying source code, making them ideal for black-box testing approaches in pre-production or staging environments.

## üõ°Ô∏è OWASP & Vulnerability Scanning Tools

DAST tools, often referred to as **Web Application Vulnerability Scanners**, play a crucial role in application security. These tools scan deployed web apps from the outside, aiming to identify exploitable vulnerabilities before attackers do.

There are many open-source and commercial DAST tools available, each with distinct features and capabilities. To evaluate the efficacy of such tools, refer to the **[OWASP Benchmark Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-benchmark/)**‚Äîa scientific initiative that measures and compares the detection capabilities of various security scanners, including DAST.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

* The tools listed are presented in **alphabetical order**.
* **OWASP does not endorse** any particular vendor or tool by listing them.
* The **Web Application Vulnerability Scanner Evaluation Project (WAVSEP)** is an independent project and **not affiliated with OWASP**. While OWASP does not endorse WAVSEP or its findings, the data may still be valuable for comparing the functionality and accuracy of both free and commercial scanners.
